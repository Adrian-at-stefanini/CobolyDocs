# Business Overview & Purpose

## System Purpose

The `svcsim01` system is a comprehensive order processing and production planning application that manages the acceptance and scheduling of steel manufacturing orders. The system serves as the central hub for coordinating order acceptance workflows, production capacity planning, and delivery date simulation across multiple manufacturing facilities.

## Core Business Functions

### Order Management Workflow
The system processes six distinct types of order-related transactions:

- **Order Acceptance Requests** (Transaction 1): Retrieves pending orders awaiting acceptance approval, allowing users to review and select orders for processing
- **Position Data Requests** (Transaction 2): Provides detailed information about specific order line items, including material specifications, delivery dates, and production requirements  
- **Position Acceptance Requests** (Transaction 6): Lists order positions ready for acceptance, displaying their current status and delivery schedules
- **Simulation Acceptance** (Transaction 10): Confirms and finalizes the production simulation, updating order status to accepted and triggering production scheduling
- **Multiple Position Processing** (Transactions 20/50): Handles batch processing of multiple order positions simultaneously for efficiency

### Production Planning and Capacity Management
The system calculates and manages production capacity across manufacturing sub-areas by:

- **Capacity Allocation**: Determines available production hours and resources for each manufacturing sub-area based on productivity data and existing commitments
- **Material Specification Processing**: Validates and processes steel specifications including diameter, thickness, length, weight, and steel grade requirements
- **Production Scheduling**: Calculates optimal production dates based on capacity availability, material requirements, and delivery commitments
- **Delivery Date Simulation**: Provides realistic delivery date estimates by analyzing production capacity, material availability, and manufacturing lead times

### Manufacturing Coordination
The system coordinates production across multiple facilities and production lines by:

- **Multi-Facility Management**: Handles orders across different manufacturing locations (DA, AR, CV, RO, SA, PI, ID, AS, KZ, UK, CN, AE) with location-specific processing rules
- **Production Line Coordination**: Manages different production processes (FTM, FAS, FAP, ACC, SIL, etc.) with specialized handling for each line type
- **Steel Type Determination**: Automatically calculates appropriate steel grades and calibers based on order specifications and manufacturing capabilities
- **Quality and Compliance Tracking**: Manages quality requirements, technical specifications, and compliance standards for each order
